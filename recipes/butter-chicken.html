    <h3>Description:</h3>
    <p>
      Butter chicken is a popular Indian dish known for its creamy and mildly
      spiced tomato-based sauce. <br />
      Tender pieces of chicken are marinated in yogurt and spices, then cooked
      in a rich sauce made with <br />
      butter, tomatoes, cream, and a blend of aromatic spices like garam masala,
      cumin, coriander, and turmeric. <br />
      It's typically served with rice or naan bread and garnished with fresh
      coriander leaves.
