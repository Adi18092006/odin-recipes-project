    <p>
        Vegetable Biryani is a fragrant and flavorful rice dish made by layering spiced vegetables and partially cooked rice. <br>
        It's a popular Indian dish where long-grain basmati rice is infused with spices, herbs, and mixed vegetables <br>
        like carrots, peas, potatoes, and cauliflower. It's cooked on a low flame to allow the flavors to meld together perfectly.
